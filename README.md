1. Basic perceptron Algorithm
2. Linear regression using numpy(manual calculations), also regression using scipy(commented)
3. Photo quality enhancement using auto Encoders
4. Decision trees on titanic dataset to see who will survive
5. Generation of digits(MNIST) using GAN
6. Naive Bayes on titanic dataset
7. PCA on some unknown dataset
8. Random Forest on Titanic Dataset
9. SVM on iris dataset
10. CNN using Tensorflow(college project)
11. K-means clustering
